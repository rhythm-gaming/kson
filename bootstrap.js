## Finishing the Setup

1. Review \`package.json\` and \`LICENSE\` to ensure correctness.
2. Install dependencies with \`pnpm install\`.
    - It is recommended to also run \`pnpm up --latest\` to update dependencies to their latest versions.
3. Remove this section.

## Development

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

- \`pnpm build\` – compile TypeScript from \`src/\` into \`dist/\`.
  - \`pnpm build:watch\` – recompile on every file change.
- \`pnpm test\` – run unit tests from \`src/**/*.spec.ts\`.
  - Don't forget to run \`pnpm build\` before running tests!
- \`pnpm lint\` – run ESLint on the source code.
- \`pnpm clean\` – remove the \`dist/\` directory.
