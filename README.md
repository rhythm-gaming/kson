# @rhythm-gaming/kson

A TypeScript library for reading and writing KSH and KSON files.

## Development

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management.

- `pnpm build` – compile TypeScript from `src/` into `dist/`.
  - `pnpm build:watch` – recompile on every file change.
- `pnpm test` – run unit tests from `src/**/*.spec.ts`.
  - Don't forget to run `pnpm build` before running tests!
- `pnpm lint` – run ESLint on the source code.
- `pnpm clean` – remove the `dist/` directory.
